This program generates incredible patterns and fractals based on sets of rules, defined differently depending which number is inputted into the textbox
effectively, every number between 1 and 255 is converted into binary, and each digit of the binary it utilised to create rules that determine the states (or in this case colours) of the pixels

working on this program and researching fractals fascinated me immensely, and once i improve my knowledge of Javascript and programming in general, i plan to make a more advanced app or website
that can simulate different types of cellular automata, complete with different features and settings!
